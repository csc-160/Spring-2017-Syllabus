## Tutor Information

* There are a couple options for tutors in this class. The Computer Science Department and the Learning Center have free tutoring available. You should make sure and take advantage of these opportunities. Further, starting the second week, this course will have a dedicated TA for the semester.


## Catalog Description

* Students will explore how to code computer programs by learning and applying concepts like variables, data types, functions, conditionals and loops. Students use code to explore and analyze structured data.

## Materials

* __Website.__ 
The website for the course is [http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/csc160/](http://math.adelphi.edu/~bstone/teaching/csc160/) as well as the GitHub organization [https://github.com/csc-160](https://github.com/csc-160).  The labs and homework assignments will be posted on GitHub. The website site will host other resources and materials. 


* __Text.__ [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - Practical Programming for Total Beginners by Al Sweigart.

## Assessment 

* __Weekly Assignments.__ Exercises to help identify mistakes in code. 

* __Projects.__ There will be 2-3 projects throughout the semester. These projects are intended to help you master various aspects of the Python programing language. 

* __Exams.__ There will be a total of two exams in the course. The exam dates and times can be found on the course calendar and are subject to change due to the nature of the course.



## Grading Rational

* The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework, quizzes, exams, and the final examination. The final grade is weighted as follows:


| Items | Percentages |
|:---|:---|
| Weekly Assignments&nbsp;&nbsp; | 20% |
| Projects | 40% |
| Exams | 40% |














## Attendance Policy

* There is no component in the grading scheme of this course for attendance. However, you will need to come to class on time in order to get the best possible grade in this class. If you miss a class for a medical reason or other valid excuse, you will be given an opportunity to make up any missing material. But if you cut class without a valid reason, your grade will suffer.

* Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for completing course work missed through absences. Students should wait a reasonable length of time for an instructor in the event that the instructor is delayed.

## Students With Disabilities

* If you have a disability that may significantly impact your ability to carry out assigned coursework, please contact the Student Access Office (SAO) at 516-877-3145 or send an email to [sao@adelphi.edu](mailto:sao@adelphi.edu).  The staff will review your concerns and determine, with you, appropriate and necessary accommodations.  Please allow for a reasonable time frame for requesting ASL Interpreters or Transcription Services.


## Course Learning Goals 

* These are my goals for you over the course of the semester. I would also be interested to hear any other goals you have for yourself.
* * • Students will be able to explain the types of problems that can be solved using computational techniques, and identify problem-solving strategies that can be implemented using code
* * • Upon completion, students will be able to explain and apply core computer coding concepts such as abstraction, variables, conditions, functions, and repetition
* * • Students will think algorithmically and be able to design and test computer programs
* * • Students will have mastered the basic syntax and idioms of a modern programming language
* * • Students will be able to use technical documentation, APIs, and other sources located on the Internet to learn new technical concepts
* * • Students will develop step by step problem solving techniques and debugging practices
* * • We will all have FUN learning together!

## Honor Code Statement

* Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:

> * The Code of Academic Honesty
> * * The code of academic honesty prohibits behavior, which can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the code of academic honesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:
> 1. Fabricating data or citations
> 2. Collaborating in areas prohibited by the professor
> 3. Unauthorized multiple submission of work
> 4. Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation
> 5. Plagiarism: presenting any work as one’s own that is not one’s own
> 6. The creation of unfair advantage
> 7. The facilitation of dishonesty
> 8. Tampering with or falsifying records
> 9. Cheating on examinations through the use of written materials or giving or receiving help in any form during the exam, including talking, signals, electronic devices, etc.


## Student Course Evaluations

* During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and
eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically.
Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.



## General Education Learning Goals & Distribution Requirements

* This course fulfills the Quantitative Learning Goal for General Education at Adelphi University. It also fulfills the Formal Science Distribution requirement.



## Classroom Conduct

* Conduct is important in the classroom as it is in the workplace.  In Adelphi classes, people are expected to treat others with respect and dignity at all times.  Any behavior, which is disruptive to the learning environment, is strictly prohibited.  Disruptive behavior may result in action including reduction in the final grade and/or withdrawal from class.



## Religious Holidays

* Any student in this course who plans to observe a religious holiday which conflicts in any way with the course schedule or requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative accommodations.
